# Flag Guesser
This is a quick project made to show HTML, CSS, JS and PHP. You can view the live version at https://daccaa.com/flagGuesser/

There are some small issues with this that would need to be fixed from a security stand point, like the fact that you could use https://daccaa.com/flagGuesser/api.php from any website not just that website - which means there is now an unofficial API that has formed and other sites could use and present the data you provide from your data.
